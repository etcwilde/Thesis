\chapter{Evaluation}

In June 2017, I conducted a study to quantitatively and qualitatively
evaluate the effectiveness of the visualizations and summaries presented
in \tool{} to the DAG-based visualizations found in Gitk and the git
command-line. The study was performed in a controlled environment
running Ubuntu 14.04. Participants were allowed to use Gitk and the git
command-line tools for these tasks, I will refer to both tools as Gitk,
when working with DAG-based visualizations and summarizations. I
considered allowing participants to use any of the free tools for Linux
suggested on the git
website\footnote{\url{https://git-scm.com/download/gui/linux}}, but
after attempting to use them, I found that none were able to operate on
repositories that were as large as the Linux repository. \tool{} was
used for evaluating the \mt{-based} visualizations.

The study has two primary goals; first determining if the DAG-based
visualization is sufficient for conceptual understanding, second
comparing \tool and Gitk to determine which is more capable of providing
users with a summarization of various metrics involved with integrating
a commit into the repository. These were done in two parts of the same
study. They were performed together as a single study for pragmatic
reasons, but could have been done as separate studies.

\section{Methodology}\label{sec:methodology}

This section describes the evaluation, how it was performed, the methods
used to ensure that things were kept consistent between participants,
and setting of the study. The evaluation was performed as a single
study, broken into two parts, using the same 12 participants and same 2
commits. The first part of the evaluation only used Gitk, while the
second part used Gitk and \tool{}. The order that the participants
studied each commit was randomized for each participant, but was kept
consistent through each part of the study. Participants would complete
part 1 of the study on both commits, the continue with part two, before
answering a few questions about their opinions and experience in an exit
survey. A screencapture with audio was taken for the duration of the
study with each participant. The videos were later analyzed and had the
information extracted into a more usable form.

Order bias was mitigated throughout the study through the use of
randomization between participants. In both parts, the order that the
participants worked with the commits, tasks, and tools was randomized.
More details about how this is done for each part are discussed in
Section~\ref{sub:conceptual_study} and~\ref{sub:summarization_study}.

Prior to starting the study, participants were introduced to the \mt{}
model and the conversion from the DAG to the \mt{}. Two examples of how
the conversion works were given, the examples shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:DAG_to_MergeTree}. Any questions about the model or
conversion were answered at this time. Then participants were introduced
to the tools, Gitk and \tool{}, and could ask questions about either
interface. These introductions usually lasted no more than 10 minutes.

\subsection{Commit Selection}\label{sub:commit_selection}

Two commits are used in both the conceptual study and summarization
study, with the goal of determining how well the DAG and \mt{}
visualizations scale between merges integrating varying numbers of
commits. The order that the two commits are presented to each
participant is randomized. I analyzed 15096 merge-trees from the
database that were candidates for the study, from April 16th 2005 to
October 14th 2014, corresponding to Linux releases 2.6.12-rc3 to
3.17-rc1. A merge-tree could only be selected if it was not a foxtrot,
and had correctly been identified. 25\% of the trees contain at most a
single repository event, not including the root, while 50\% of the trees
contain at most seven nodes. 75\% of the trees contain at least 51
nodes, and the largest tree contains 7217 nodes. 8031 trees contained at
least seven nodes, of these only 593 contained at least a single
internal merge node. Trivially, trees with a single node cannot have any
internal merge nodes. Of the 624 trees with seven non-root node, only
135 contained at least one inner node. Using this information, I chose a
random tree from the 2008 trees in the first quartile, which merges a
single commit into the master branch. These trees are trivial, but
appear frequently in the repository. The second tree was chosen randomly
from trees in the second quartile. These trees contain seven nodes, and
to increase the complexity of the tree, I required that the tree contain
at least one internal merge node.

Once the trees were selected, I had to select a commit from the tree.
Selecting a commit from the small tree was trivial, there was only a
single node to choose. From the medium-sized tree, I used a script to
select a commit randomly. The commits selected from the small tree and
medium tree were \emph{a3c1239eb59c0a907f8be5587d42e950f44543f8} and
\emph{cdbdd1676a5379f1d5cbd4d476f5e349f445befe} respectively. Commit 1,
the commit from the small tree is visualized in
Figure~\ref{fig:commit_1_visualization}, showing the DAG visualization
by Gitk and \rt{} tree visualization in Linvis. The same is
shown for commit 2 in Figure~\ref{fig:commit_2_visualization}.

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{The visualizations of commit 2 by Gitk and Linvis
    respectively.}
  \label{fig:commit_2_visualization}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Part 1: Conceptual Study}\label{sub:conceptual_study}

The conceptual portion of the study verifies our initial assumption,
that the DAG visualization is unable to provide people with a conceptual
understanding of the events in a repository. Participants in the study
are asked to perform tasks that are related to understanding how a
commit is integrated. The tasks for this part of the study are outlined
in Table~\ref{tab:conceptual_tasks}.

\begin{table*}[htpb]
  \centering
  \caption{Conceptual Tasks}
  \label{tab:conceptual_tasks}
  \begin{tabulary}{0.9\textwidth}{LL}
    \toprule
    Task & Description\\
    \midrule
    T1 & Draw a diagram showing how this commit was merged into the master branch, along with any other related commits\\
    T2 & How many individual commits are related to this commit?\\
    T3 & How many merges are involved with merging this commit into the master branch?\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabulary}
\end{table*}

Task 1 asks participants to draw a diagram showing the shortest path for
a commit to be merged, including any commits that are related to it, or
are necessary for the integration. Participants were given 10 minutes to
draw the diagram. The correct answer should look something like the
merge-tree for that commit. The drawing from Task 1 is then referred to
in Task 2 and 3. Building on the conceptual understanding built in task
1, task 2 and 3 ask the participant to determine how many commits are
related, and how many merges. The order that task 2 and 3 are presented
to participants is randomized between participants, to remove order
bias, although it shouldn't matter as both questions are designed to
build off of task 1 and the conceptual understanding constructed  from
analyzing the DAG visualization of that commit for 10 minutes. These
questions enable us to find issues when users are comprehending the DAG
visualizations.

The diagrams drawn by the participants in the first task help provide
insight about how the participants are interpreting the DAG. I looked
for patterns in the drawings to see if common issues arose, providing
qualitative information about issues in comprehension. The results from
task 2 and 3 are numerical results, the number of commits that are
related, and the number of merges. These numbers are directly comparable
with the correct numbers.

\subsection{Part 2: Summarization Study}\label{sub:summarization_study}

The summarization portion of the study compares the visualization and
summarization capabilities of \tool{} and Gitk to determine if the
visualization of the \mt{} is capable of providing a better
understanding of the events in repository, specifically answering
RQ\ref{RQ2} and RQ\ref{RQ3}. This portion of the study requires the
participants to switch between both Use-Case 1 and Use-Case 2
strategies. The participants are provided an commit, since their goal is
to summarize information about the entire merge-tree, they must navigate
to the root node, making use of features for Use-Case 1. Once they are
at the root, the participant must be able to summarize information about
the authors, files, and modules. The tasks are outline in
Table~\ref{tab:summarization_tasks}.

\begin{table}[htpb]
  \centering
  \caption{Summarization Tasks}
  \label{tab:summarization_tasks}
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \toprule
    Task Set   & Task & Description\\\midrule
    Merge      & T4   & What is the series of merges involved with merging this
    commit?\\
               & T5   & What other commits are merged?\\
    Authorship & T6   & How many authors are involved?\\
               & T7   & Who contributed the most changes?\\
    Files      & T8   & How many files were modified?\\
               & T9   & Which file had the most changes?\\
    Modules    & T10  & Which modules does this \mt involve?\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

With some exceptions, three metrics are recorded from each task;
correctness, accuracy, and time taken. Correctness is simply whether the
response was correct. Accuracy is how far from the response was from the
correct answer. An Accuracy of zero indicates that the answer was
correct. Time indicates how long the participant took to respond. Time
is measured from the end of the question to the beginning of the final
response. Since the time measures until the final modification to the
answer, it is possible for times to overlap between tasks if the
participant were to change their response after answering another
question.

The tasks are split into four task sets, based on the type of
information that the task is investigating. The \emph{Merge} tasks set
focuses on detailed information about the topology of the merge itself,
looking at the specific merges and commits involved in the integration.
Task T4 asks for the specific merges that merge the commit into the
master branch. These must be the correct merges, and must be in the
correct order. I use the edit distance between the response and the
correct answer as a measure of how correct the response is. Adding new
merges, removing extraneous merges, replacing merges, and swapping the
order of merges are of unit cost. An edit distance of 0 indicates a
correct answer. Task T5 asks for the other commits that are integrated
with this commit. Again, I use an edit distance-like metric to evaluate
the response. Order doesn't matter, but the correct commits must be
indicated in the response. Adding commits, replacing commits, and
removing commits are of unit cost.

The \emph{authorship} task set involves finding information about the
authors involved in the merge. Task T6 asks for the number of authors
involved in the merge. These are authors of commits, not merges, as
merges in the kernel repository do not include code, and are used for
creating logical separation in commits. The accuracy is measured as the
absolute difference between the response and the correct answer. Task T7
asks participants to identify the person who was responsible for
contributing the most in the merge. While it is possible that two
authors could have contributed the same number of changes, in the merges
for both commits, there is an identifiable author who contributed the
most. The answer to this task can either be correct or incorrect, so
accuracy is not recorded for this task.

The \emph{files} task set involves finding information about specific
files being merged. Task T8 asks the participant to identify how many
files are modified in a merge. Like task T6, the response to task T8 is
a single number, so the accuracy is measured as the absolute difference
between the response and the correct answer. Task T9 asks the
participants to identify which files had the most lines modified in
the merge. While this is similar to task T7, the files in the tree
associated with commit 1 had the same number of changes. For this
reason, I use the edit distance between the response and the correct
answer, with addition, removal, and replacement of unit cost.

The \emph{modules} task set only contains a single task, and involves
determining the modules involved in a merge. Modules, or subsystems,
refer to the component of the kernel that is being modified by a commit.
This is not a property that is inherent to git repositories in general,
but a property we noticed in the repository of the Linux kernel. Commit
summaries are prefaced with the module, followed by a colon. For example
the log summary \textit{``ALSA: kernel docs: fix sound/core/
  kernel-doc''} is in the \textit{``ALSA''} module.

\subsection{User Opinions and Exit Interview}
\label{sub:user_opinions_and_exit_interview}

The goal in this part of the study is to expose issues in the underlying
assumptions made while writing \tool{}. Two questions were asked in this
part of the study, outlined in Table~\ref{tab:opinion_questions}.

\begin{table}[htpb]
  \centering
  \caption{User Opinion Questions}
  \label{tab:opinion_questions}
  \begin{tabulary}{0.9\textwidth}{LL}
    \toprule
    Question & Description\\
    \midrule
    Q1 & Given these tasks again, which tool would you prefer?\\
    Q2 & Which aspects of each tool did you like and why?\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabulary}
\end{table}


The exit interview is designed with the goal of collecting some
information about our participants, and their experience with version
control software and git. Three questions were asked in the exit
interview portion of the study;

\begin{itemize}
  \item For how long have you used git?
  \item For what kind of projects have you used git?
  \item How many commits, files, and collaborators were involved with
    the largest repository you have worked with?
\end{itemize}
