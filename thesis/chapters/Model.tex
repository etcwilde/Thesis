\chapter{Model}\label{chap:Model}

Leveraging the topological information in Chapter~\ref{chap:background},
we design a model that groups commits by the integrating merge into the
master branch. Since the merges into the Linux kernel are atomic, all
the context necessary for merging a commit is available at the
integrating merge. The model is a tree-based model that we call the
\mt{}.

The \mt model abstracts the DAG of the repository into a set of \mt{s}.
Each \mt is rooted at a merge into the master branch. The leaves of this
tree are the commits and the merges are the inner nodes. A \mt is built
recursively with every merge in the \mt merging a sub-\mt. Any merges
that a commit must pass through to reach the master branch become an
inner node of the tree. Effectively, a \mt is a tree that shows the path
that commits follow in their way to the master branch of a repository.
The \mt{s} also help understand how commits were grouped together in
order to be integrated. In this model, not only has the DAG been
inverted (and simplified), but the entire notion of parent-child
relationship has been reversed. Due to this property, the terminology
will be different depending on the model we are referring to; when we
are referring to the \mt, the parent is the next node toward the merge
into the master branch, or the root of the tree. When referring to the
DAG, the parent relationship is in the opposite direction, from the root
toward the branch-point. In addition to identifying the path that a
commit took to being merged, we are able to aggregate the commit
metadata at merges as we retain the parent-child and child-parent
relationship for each event and know which commits belong to the merge.

To illustrate this model we will use a small example: assume the commits
represented in Figure~\ref{fig:repoEvents} show the sequence of events
in a repository. The sequence starts with the initial commit in the
master branch of the master repository at time $t_0$. Repository event 1
is a commit, which gets forked into a separate repository, \textit{Repo
  A}, where another commit is made, event 2. Event 5 is a merge event,
merging event 2, 3, and 4 into \textit{Repo A}. Event 5 is branched
from, commit 6 happens in the new branch, while commit 7 is added
simultaneously to the original branch in \textit{Repo A}. Events 11 and
12 are both merge events, merging changes made in \textit{Repo A} into
the master branch of the master repository. As every repository is a
first-class repository, including local copies and forks, git does not
distinguish between forked repositories and branches, and in neither
case does it explicitly record where a commit was made. In this case,
commits are performed in various repositories and branches. The DAG
representation of these events is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:repoDAG}.

The DAG does not retain information about where a commit was originally
created beyond the order of the events in the parent list. This is
necessary to provide complete flexibility to users, but at the expense
of maintaining a consistent history. Ideally, we would be able to
completely reconstruct the information in Figure~\ref{fig:repoEvents}
from Figure~\ref{fig:repoDAG}, but this may not be possible. Instead, we
focus on determining the next merge that leads to the integration of a
commit. Depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:repoTree}, is the first version of
the \mt. It does not completely rebuild the lost information, but is
able to show the sequence of merges that a commit follows to be
integrated, and the commits that were involved with the integration.

Using the depth of the node from the root of the tree, we are able to
reconstruct the branch information. In our events, nodes 2, 5, 7, and 9,
are all on the same branch, and are merged into node 11. Nodes 5 and 9
are merge nodes, 5 merges a single commit into the branch, and 9 merges
two nodes into the branch. In some cases, it is possible that a commit
was merged twice. In the case of node 9, it is merged into 11, though it
could also be merged into 12 through 10. We design the merge tree to use
the shortest distance in hops, and use distance in time as a tie
breaker.

\section{Algorithm}
\label{sec:algorithm}

Computing the \mt from a DAG for any repository may not be possible;
however, certain features of the development process of Linux make it
feasible to compute the \mt for the Linux repository. First, the master
branch of Linux is maintained by Linus Torvalds, and only Linus has
write access to it. We have verified this assertion in previous
research~\cite{German2015}. We have developed a heuristic that is
presented in Algorithm~\ref{fig:alg}. In short, the algorithm first
identifies the commits made directly to the master branch, whereafter it
recursively determines the shortest path, using the DAG, from each
commit to the master branch using the inverted DAG.\@

The algorithm is broken into two phases. The first is determining which
repository events are on the master branch. This is done by traversing
the first parent from the master branch reference to the commit that has
no parents. The second phase is encompassed by the function
$MergeAtMaster$ which determines, for each commit, which merge the
commit is merged at, the depth (as variable $d$ in the algorithm), and
the next merge on the path to the master branch. The function
$MergeAtMaster$ has two parts, the first for determining the depth, from
the master branch, that the repository event is at. The second phase
determines the merge into the master branch, and the next merge on the
way to the master branch. The distance is by shortest path, staying as
close to the master branch as possible. If there is a tie between two
paths, the path that merges into the master branch sooner is taken.

To demonstrate the behaviour of the algorithm, we use a short example,
computing the merge at commit 5 in Figure~\ref{fig:repoEvents}.
$MergeAtMaster$, recurses along the children of the nodes it visits.
Eventually every child of every node along the path will be visited at
least once. Without loss of generality, suppose that the path recursed
along is from node 5 to 6, 9, 10, and finally 12.

The depth for each, except 12 (a merge into the master branch), is
initialized to infinity, the merge into master is blank, and the next
merge is blank. Merges into master trivially have a distance of 0 from
the master branch, and it merges itself into the master branch. The
recursion at 12 returns the triple $(0, \varnothing, 12)$ to the call
from 10. 12 is a merge commit and 10 is not the first parent, so the
temporary depth, $d_c$, is incremented to 1 and the temporary next
merge, $next_c$, is changed to 12. 1 is less than infinity, so the depth
is set to 1, the merge to 12, and the next to 12. This returns the
triple $(1, 12, 12)$ to the call from 9. 9 is the first parent of 10, so
no changes are made to the temporary variables.

The call to 9 recurses to the second child, 11. 11 is a merge into the
master so it returns $(0, \varnothing, 11)$ to the call from 9. 9 is not
the first parent of 11, so the $d_c$ is incremented to 1 and $next_c$ is
changed to 11. The distances $d_c$ and $d$ are the same, so to break the
tie, we use the time. 12 was merged after 11, so 11 replaces 12 as the
merge into the master branch for 9, as well as being the next merge. The
call for 9 returns the triple $(1, 11, 11)$ to the call for 6. 6 is not
the first parent of 9, so $d_c$ is incremented and $next_c$ is changed
to 9, as 9 merges 6. 2 is less than infinity, so the $d$ is changed to
2, the merge to 11, and the next merge to 9. The call to 6 returns the
triple $(2, 11, 9)$ to the call for 5.

The call for 5 recurses on the second child of 5, calling on 7, which
calls 8, and then 9. 9 can continue, but if the implementation of the
algorithm uses memoization, the call to 9 can immediately return the
triple $(1, 11, 11)$ to the call for 8, and avoid an exponential
runtime. 8 is not the first parent of 8, so $d_c$ is incremented to 2
and $next_c$ is changed to 9. 2 is less than infinity, so $d$ is changed
to 2, $merge$ to 11, and $next$ to 9. The call to 8 returns the triple
$(2, 11, 9)$ to the call for 7, which recurses on the second child of 7,
9. 9 returns the triple $(1, 11, 11)$. 7 is the first parent of 9, so
the depth is not incremented. $d_c$ is less than $d$, so $d$ is changed
to 1, $m$ to 11, and $next$ to 11, returning $(1, 11, 11)$ to the call
for 5. $d_c$ is less than $d$, so $d$ is changed to 1, $m$ to 11, and
$next$ to 11. There are no other children, so the function halts.
