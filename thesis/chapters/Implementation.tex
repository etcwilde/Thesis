\chapter{Implementation Details}

The implementation is broken into two parts, the tool and the database.
The database uses postgresql, an advanced opensource database management
system. The tool backend uses Python and the Flask framework.
Both the database and the \tool{} backend are containerized using
Docker. This facilitates easy migration between the development
environment and the server where the system is running. Both components
are running Alpine 3.5, a simple, light, and secure distribution of
Linux designed to run as the base of Docker containers. Containers are
similar to virtual machines, but easier to work with. Instead of using
virtualization of the hardware, Docker containers run on top of the host
kernel, making use of \textit{cgroups} to allocate resources to the
container. Since the container is not a full virtual machine, it only
needs to contain the information required to run the service. There are
no device drivers, or even a kernel. A container image can be exported
and imported from the development environment directly into the
production environment.

This chapter contains details on the design of the database, the
extraction of the data, and the implementation of the tool.
