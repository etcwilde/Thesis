\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:conclusion}

The goals of this \paper{} are to introduce a new model for providing
git users a better understanding of how a commit is integrated into the
master branch of a repository. The issue surrounding comprehension of
visualizations of the DAG motivates this work. The \paper{} presents a
new mode, an algorithm and a validation of that algorithm, a tool, and a
user study of the tool, to remedy, and evaluate the effect of the new
model to remedy this issue.
